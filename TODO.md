To create an interface for the daughter to update the inventory and manage orders using RedwoodJS, follow these steps:

Item inventory: The Item model should have a quantity property to represent the available quantity of each item. Whenever an order is placed, you can decrement the quantity of the corresponding items. If the daughter updates the inventory throughout the day, you can provide her with an interface to update the quantity of items in the database. This can be done through a separate admin panel or a protected route that only the daughter can access.

1. Create a new layout for the admin panel, e.g., `AdminLayout`.
2. Create a new page for managing inventory, e.g., `InventoryPage`, and use the `AdminLayout`.
3. Create a new component for updating item quantities, e.g., `UpdateItemQuantity`.
4. Create a cell for fetching and updating item quantities, e.g., `UpdateItemQuantityCell`.
5. Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to the inventory page only to the daughter.
6. Update the `InventoryPage` to include the `UpdateItemQuantity` component and the `UpdateItemQuantityCell`.
7. Create a new page for managing orders, e.g., `AdminOrdersPage`, and use the `AdminLayout`.
8. Create a new component for updating order statuses, e.g., `UpdateOrderStatus`.
9. Create a cell for fetching and updating order statuses, e.g., `UpdateOrderStatusCell`.
10. Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to the admin orders page only to the daughter.
11. Update the `AdminOrdersPage` to include the `UpdateOrderStatus` component and the `UpdateOrderStatusCell`.
12. Create services and SDLs for updating item quantities and order statuses. Refer to the RedwoodJS documentation on [services](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/services) and [testing](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing) for more information on implementing these features.



2. Tracking orders: The Order model should have a reference to the User model to associate the order with the customer. It can also have a reference to the OrderItem model to track the items included in the order. The Order model can have a status property to represent the current status of the order (e.g., pending, in delivery, delivered). The daughter can update the order status through the OrdersPage, and customers can track their orders by viewing the order status.

1. Create a new page for displaying orders, e.g., `OrdersPage`.
2. Create a new component for displaying individual orders and their statuses, e.g., `OrderCard`.
3. Create a cell for fetching orders and their associated information, e.g., `OrdersCell`.
4. Update the `OrdersPage` to include the `OrdersCell` and render the `OrderCard` component for each order.
5. Create a new component for updating order statuses, e.g., `UpdateOrderStatus`.
6. Create a cell for fetching and updating order statuses, e.g., `UpdateOrderStatusCell`.
7. Update the `OrderCard` component to include the `UpdateOrderStatus` component and the `UpdateOrderStatusCell`.
8. Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to the `OrdersPage` only to the daughter and the customers who placed the orders.
9. Create services and SDLs for fetching orders and updating order statuses. Refer to the RedwoodJS documentation on [services](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/services) and [testing](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing) for more information on implementing these features.
